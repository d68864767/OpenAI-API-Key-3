# SDK Integration

In this section, we will discuss how to integrate the OpenAI API with your project using the OpenAI SDK (Software Development Kit). The SDK provides a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that makes it easier to interact with the API.

## Installation

Before you can use the OpenAI SDK, you need to install it. The SDK is available for several programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and more. Here is how you can install the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Configuration

After installing the SDK, you need to configure it to use your OpenAI API key. You can do this by setting the `openai.api_key` variable in your code:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
```

Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the OpenAI SDK to interact with the API:

### Text Generation

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-002",
  prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
  max_tokens=60
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

### Chat Models

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

Remember to replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key in the above examples.

## SDK Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when using the OpenAI SDK:

- Always keep your API key secure. Never expose it in public repositories or client-side code.
- Handle API responses and errors properly to ensure your application runs smoothly.
- Keep your SDK up-to-date to benefit from the latest features and improvements.
- Use the appropriate model and settings for your specific use case to get the best results.
