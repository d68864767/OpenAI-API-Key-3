# Legal Agreements

When using the OpenAI API, you are bound by certain legal agreements. These agreements are designed to protect both you and OpenAI, and to ensure that the API is used responsibly and ethically. This document provides an overview of these agreements.

## API Terms of Use

The API Terms of Use is a legal agreement between you (the user) and OpenAI. It outlines the terms and conditions for using the API. By using the API, you agree to these terms.

The API Terms of Use covers various aspects of API usage, including but not limited to:

- Acceptance of terms
- API usage limitations
- User responsibilities
- Data privacy and security
- Intellectual property rights
- Termination of access
- Dispute resolution

You should read the API Terms of Use carefully before using the API. The latest version of the API Terms of Use can be found on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/legal).

## Licensing Agreements

When you use the OpenAI API, you may also be bound by certain licensing agreements. These agreements pertain to the use of OpenAI's proprietary models and software.

The licensing agreements cover aspects such as:

- Grant of license
- Restrictions on use
- Ownership of intellectual property
- Termination of license

You should review the licensing agreements carefully to understand your rights and obligations.

## API Key Generation

The generation and use of API keys is governed by the API Terms of Use and the OpenAI API Key Policy. You are responsible for keeping your API keys secure and for all API calls made using your keys.

For more information on API key generation and security, refer to the [OpenAI API Key](OpenAI_API_Key.md) document.

## Compliance with Legal Agreements

Failure to comply with the API Terms of Use, licensing agreements, or any other legal agreements can result in penalties, including termination of your access to the API.
